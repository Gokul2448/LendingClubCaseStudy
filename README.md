# Lending Club Case Study 
Lending Club, a consumer finance marketplace that specialises in providing a variety of loans to urban customers, is facing a significant issue in handling the loan approval process. When analysing loan applications, the corporation must make wise decisions to reduce financial losses, which are primarily caused by loans provided to applicants that are deemed "risky."
These financial losses, known as credit losses, happen when borrowers fail to repay their loans or default. Simply put, "charged-off" creditors are liable for the company's most severe losses.

The major goal of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in reducing credit loss. This challenge stems from two possible scenarios:


- Identifying applicants who are likely to repay their loans is critical since they can produce revenue for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such candidates would mean a loss of potential business.
- On the other side, accepting loans for applicants who are unlikely to repay and are at danger of default can result in significant financial losses to the organisation.

## General Information
The goal is to identify applicants who are likely to default on loans, resulting in less credit losses. This case study tries to achieve this goal by conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset (loan.csv).

The organisation wishes to identify the underlying causes (or driver variables) of loan default, i.e. the variables that are significant indicators of default. This knowledge can be used by the company to examine its portfolio and risks.

The major goal of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in reducing credit loss. This challenge stems from two possible scenarios:

1. Identifying applicants who are likely to repay their loans is critical, as interest payments can generate revenues for the company. Rejecting such candidates would mean a loss of potential business.
2. On the other side, accepting loans for applicants who are unlikely to repay and are at danger of default can result in significant financial losses to the organisation.
